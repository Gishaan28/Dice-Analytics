    <h2>Fair Analytics</h2> <p>
This app simulates the rolling of 2 dice and the number generated conforms to the distribution of how many times a number should appear. 

2 -> 2.8% 
3 -> 5.6%
4 -> 8.3%
5 -> 11.1%
6 -> 13.9%
7 -> 16.7%
8 -> 13.9%
9 -> 11.1%
10 -> 8.3%
11 -> 5.6%
12 -> 2.8%. 

Keep in mind, this app produces RANDOM NUMBER, but is smart enough to learn from the previous number that has already come and then produce the next number according to the right distribution. A totally random dice would produce this kind of distribution over 1000s of turns but this dice produces it in 40-50 turns. The app also shows the statistics of the numbers that came and how many times they should have come.

How the app works:
1. Download the app.
2. Press on the "Start Game" button. This would start the timer and would start counting the numbers. 
3. Press the "Roll" button to roll the dice. 
4. Press on the "See Analytics" button to see the stats anytime during the game.

Play for 40-50 turns and you would start seeing the right distribution on the graph.
